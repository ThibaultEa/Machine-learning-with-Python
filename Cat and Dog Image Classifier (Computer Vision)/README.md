# Cat and Dog Image Classifier
Please run the notebook under Google Colab. The code was adapted to use tensorflow.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory instead of tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator (deprecated).

For this challenge, you will complete the code to classify images of dogs and cats. You will use TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time. (Extra credit if you get it to 70% accuracy!)
